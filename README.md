## 💡 Features  
✅ Add multiple processes with **arrival time, burst time, and priority**  
✅ Supports **multiple scheduling algorithms** (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR, etc.)  
✅ **Time quantum input** for Round Robin scheduling  
✅ Generates a **Gantt chart** dynamically  
✅ Displays **waiting time, turnaround time, and averages**  
✅ Responsive & clean UI for a smooth user experience  

## 📖 Implemented Scheduling Algorithms  
- 🕒 **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**  
- ⚡ **Shortest Job First (SJF)**  
- ⏳ **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**  
- 🔁 **Round Robin (RR)**  
- ⭐ **Priority Scheduling** (if included in your code)
